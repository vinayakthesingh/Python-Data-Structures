10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.







fname = input("Enter the file name:")
handle1 = open(fname)
#handle = handle1.read()
counts = dict()

for lines in handle1:
    if lines.startswith('From '):
        words = lines.split()
        stuff = words[5]
        #print(stuff)
        hr = stuff.split(':')
        hrs = hr[0]
        counts[hrs] = counts.get(hrs,0) + 1
        
#t = sorted(counts.items())
for k,v in sorted(counts.items()):
    print(k,v)
