9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.







name = input("Enter file: ")
handle = open(name)
counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
        continue
    words = line.split()
    stuff = words[1]
    if stuff not in counts:
        counts[stuff] = 1
    else:
        counts[stuff] = counts[stuff] + 1
        
bigword = None
bigcount = None

for w,c in counts.items():
    if bigcount is None or c>bigcount:
        bigword = w
        bigcount = c

print(bigword,bigcount)
